# PT client library for PHP

This  is a client library  written in  PHP for all of  our internal  software which has API access. All the inhouse developed software use the same API and authentication  logic  so the  same API client library  can be used for  all. 

We have this library in PHP, Python, c# but currently only the PHP version is public.
